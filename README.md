I've included sections for describing the project, how to generate random dummy data, and how to customize percentages for difficulty and topics.

## Overview

This project is a Question Paper Generator application implemented in Node.js. It generates a question paper based on random dummy data with attributes like question, subject, topic, difficulty, and marks.

## How to Generate Random Dummy Data

Random dummy data is generated by passing the amount of data to the `generateDummyData` function.

```javascript
const generateDummyData = (count) => {
  // ... implementation details ...
};

const questionStore = generateDummyData(100);
```

## Customizing Difficulty Percentages

You can customize the values of Easy, Medium, and Hard percentages by editing the `difficultyDistribution` object in your code.

```javascript
const difficultyDistribution = {
  Easy: 20,
  Medium: 50,
  Hard: 30,
};
```

## Customizing Topic Percentages

You can customize the values of topic percentages by editing the `topicDistribution` object in your code.

![Topic Percentages](https://github.com/saikrishnayadav764/reelo_questionPaperGeneration/assets/106056182/4782f284-68cc-4a6e-95a2-eb6e252b270c)

```javascript
const topicDistribution = {
  Topic1: 40,
  Topic2: 60,
  // Add more topics as needed
};
```

## Customizing Percentages of Topics Under Easy, Medium, Hard

You can edit values of percentages of topics under Easy, Medium, and Hard by modifying the `topicDistribution` object accordingly.

![Percentages of Topics](https://github.com/saikrishnayadav764/reelo_questionPaperGeneration/assets/106056182/400df84b-3f67-4c84-addd-a4b7698e4be3)

```javascript
const topicDistribution = {
  Easy: {
    Topic1: 40,
    Topic2: 60,
    // Add more topics as needed
  },
  Medium: {
    Topic1: 30,
    Topic2: 50,
    // Add more topics as needed
  },
  Hard: {
    Topic1: 20,
    Topic2: 30,
    // Add more topics as needed
  },
};
```
